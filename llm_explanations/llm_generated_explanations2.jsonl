The value of 2 indicates that there is an excessive margin above the face in the left side of the image. This can lead to incorrect facial recognition and potentially compromise the security of the biometric system.\n\nTo address this issue, the following actions should be taken:\n\n1. **Adjust the image cropping**: Review the image processing pipeline to ensure that the face detection algorithm is correctly identifying and cropping the face region. Adjust the cropping parameters as needed to minimize the margin above the face.\n2. **Improve face detection**: Consider using a more advanced face detection algorithm or fine-tuning the existing one to better detect faces in images with varying lighting conditions, angles, and occlusions.\n3. **Verify image quality**: Check if the image has been properly preprocessed (e.g., noise reduction, contrast enhancement) before passing it through the biometric system. Poor image quality can lead to incorrect face detection and recognition.\n4. **Re-run the biometric analysis**: Once the above issues are addressed, re-run the biometric analysis on a new set of images to verify that the corrected process produces accurate results.\n\nBy addressing this primary defect, you should be able to improve the overall performance and reliability of your biometric system."}
